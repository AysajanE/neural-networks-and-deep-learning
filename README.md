# Neural Network and Deep Learning: From First Principles

## Introduction

Welcome to my personal learning journey into the fascinating world of neural networks and deep learning! This repository documents my progress as I build understanding from the ground up, following Michael Nielsen's excellent online textbook ["Neural Networks and Deep Learning"](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html).

## Purpose

The primary goals of this repository are:

1. To record my learning process, from theory to practical implementation
2. To share code examples and exercises as I work through the concepts
3. To create a resource that others might find helpful in their own learning journeys

## Content

This repository will include:

- Code implementations of key concepts
- Notes and summaries of important ideas
- Exercises and their solutions
- Visualizations to aid understanding
- Personal reflections and insights gained along the way

## Structure

The repository is organized to follow the structure of Nielsen's textbook:

1. Using neural nets to recognize handwritten digits
2. How the backpropagation algorithm works
3. Improving the way neural networks learn
4. A visual proof that neural nets can compute any function
5. Why are deep neural networks hard to train?
6. Deep learning

Each section will have its own directory containing relevant code, notes, and exercises.

## Getting Started

To use this repository:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or later recommended)
3. Install required libraries (requirements will be updated as the project progresses)

## Current Progress

- Implemented the sigmoid function and created visualizations

## Future Plans

- Work through each chapter of the textbook
- Implement a full neural network from scratch
- Explore advanced topics in deep learning

## Contributions

While this is primarily a personal learning project, I welcome discussions, suggestions, and corrections. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you'd like to contribute.
